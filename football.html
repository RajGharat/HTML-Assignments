    <p>Association football, more commonly known as simply <strong>football or soccer,</strong> is a team sport played between two teams
        of <strong> 11 players</strong> with the use of a spherical ball. An estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries
        and dependencies makes it the world's most popular sport to date. The game is played on a rectangular field
        called a pitch with a goal at each end. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposition by
        moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing side's goal in the time frame of 90 minutes plus stoppage
        time and occasionally also extra time.

        The game of football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the <strong>Laws of the Game</strong>. The ball is
        68-70 cm (27-28 in) in circumference and known as the football. The two teams compete to get the ball into the
        other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. Players are not allowed to
        touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the goalkeepers within the penalty area.
        Players may use any other part of their body to strike or pass the ball and mainly use their feet. The team that
        has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals,
        either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout, depending on the format of the
        competition. Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of
        the Game: to represent their team in the coin toss before kick-off or penalty kicks.</p>
